# Why
I have found a need on several occasions to take a group of files and quickly spread them out, so to speak. The need for context and establishing a feeling or direction has cropped up in both my professional and personal work. After examining the available tools out there (Pinterest, Evernote, etc) I found that I didn't want to adapt to a new ecosystem; I wanted to simply have the ability to take a group of files and see them all in context.
